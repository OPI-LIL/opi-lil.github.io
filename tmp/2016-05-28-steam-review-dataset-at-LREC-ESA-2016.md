During Social Simulation Conference 2016 (taking place in Rome, 20-23 September) we presented our research on the topic of automatic detection of users producing large amount of emotion evoking content - trolls - using statistical and network features, without resorting to standard sentiment analysis approach. We used data coming from [Onet.pl](http://www.onet.pl) - one of the largest polish news website - that allows users to comment on news pieces and discuss in structurized tree format.  We have found that our algorithm allowed us to autmatically build model for detecting trolls based only on their posting patterns, and network structure of the discussion.

## Introduction
This paper introduces binary sentiment classification dataset containing over 3,640,386 reviews in English. Contrary to other popular sentiment corpora (like Amazon reviews dataset or IMBD reviews dataset)  Steam Review Dataset is also annotated by Steam community members providing insightful information about what other users consider helpful or funny. Additionally, for each game we have gathered all available screen-shots which could be used for learning inter-modal correspondences between textual and visual data. We believe that our dataset opens new directions of research for the NLP community.

Steam User Reviews, online review part of Steam gaming platform, developed by Valve Corporation, are one of more prominent ways of interaction between Steam Platfrom users, allowing them to share their views and experiences with games sold on platform. This allows users to drive sales of a game up or slow them down to the point of product being removed from sale, as online user reviews are known to influence purchasing decisions, both by their content and volume.

Each review is manually tagged by author as either positive or negative before posting. It also contains authors user name (Steam Display Name), number of hours user played the game, number of games owned by the user and number of reviews written by user.

After the review is online, other Steam users can tag review as Useful/Not Useful (which add to Total score) or Funny. Useful/Not Useful score is used to generate Usefulness score (percentage of Useful score to Total). Funny score is different -- it does not count into total, and allows user to tag review as Funny only.
