It's a great pleasure to inform that the CTI consortium was selected to the group of POIG 2.3 projects funded by NCBR. CTI is a shortcut for the "Centrum Technologii Informacyjnych Nauk Humanistyczno-Społecznych". The main goal of the consortium is to build innovative hardware and software infrastructure for lawyers, sociologists, psychologists and other humanists. The project is scheduled to take place from 09.2014 till 11.2015.

The consortium consists of three members:

 - Uniwersytete Kardynała Stefana Wyszyńskiego (UKSW)
 - Wojskowy Instytut Medycyny Lotniczej (WIML)
 - Ośrodek Przetwarzania Informacji (OPI)
 
 OPI as a member of the consortium is responsible for delivering software infrastructure, namely  three modules:
 
 - Eprawo - module supporting lawyers with text mining functionalities e.g. as classifiers, machine translation, or search engines
 - Esurvey - module responsibles for creating questionnaires in a drag-and-drop wizzard mode and sending them to respondents
 - Eanalytics - module supporting social sciences researchers in performing the qualitative analysis of various data (statistical tools, predicative and simulation methods)
