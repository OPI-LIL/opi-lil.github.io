Next triple of publications submitted during the the International Conference on Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence, Warsaw, Poland, 2015, June 30 - July 3. Below, we briefly describe three of submitted papers referring to: machine translation, clustering semi-structured documents and semantic textual similarity.

### Statistical Machine Translation of the Legal Texts###

Machine Translation is a branch of computer science that automatically handles translation of a text from a source language to a target language. This article summarizes the experience gained during UKSW project, part of which deals with translation of legal phrases between English and Polish. The article describes consecutive steps of the project, ie. collecting data and creating parallel, bilingual corpora, checking open source ready-made solutions and the novel, effective SMT solution that has been proposed. The final chapter summarizes the solution, together with the results based on BLEU metrics. 

### Clustering semi-structured documents describing KRK competences ###

The paper refers to the topic of clustering semi-structured documents, namely documents describing study field's KRK competences. KRK competences are the specialized description of the abilities/qualifications, which students gain after graduation from the given study field. The proposed method enables extracting and processing KRK competences from diverse types of semi-structured documents. It consists of two stages: (1) entity extraction from documents (building vectors of KRK competences for each study field), and (2) clustering study fields using those competence representations. Polish KRK competence files, describing almost 3000 study fields in Poland, were used as corpora. The method and its stages are thoroughly analyzed. The results allow to compare and identify similar study fields according to theirs final effects of education.

### Semantic Textual Similarity using various approaches ###

The paper is devoted to the semantic textual similarity (STS) problem. Given two sentences of text, s1 and s2, the systems participating in this problem should compute how similar s1 and s2 are, returning a similarity score, and an optional confidence score. We present ours experience in this topic, ranging from the knowledge-poor approaches to some compact and easy applied knowledge-rich methods (using structured knowledge base frameworks like WordNet, Wikipedia or BabelNet). The evaluation of the proposed methods was performed using the datasets from SemEval-2014/15 tasks.
