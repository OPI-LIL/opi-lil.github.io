During Social Simulation Conference 2016 (taking place in Rome, 20-23 September) we presented poster regarding our research
on on the topic of automatic detection of users producing large amount of emotion evoking content - trolls - using statistical and network features, without resorting to standard sentiment analysis approach - with addition of initial alalysis of Engliesh language based source - [hltv.org](http://www.hltv.org) website that hosts news regarding Counter Strike: Global Offensive. Discussion on that website are also highly polarized - as CS:GO is team based e-sports - and well structurized. We have found that our algorithm - build on Polish political content - works very well in this enviromant with no changes to its core.

## Abstract and Conslusions
The discussions in political forums in Poland often contain large amounts of direct and indirect insults towards politicians. Indirect insults are often expressed as nicknames heavily associated with the politician's name, personal history, and public events they took part in. We propose a novel method of automatic detection of users who write emotion evoking posts in Internet discussions, which uses such nicknames as keywords, and takes posting activity patterns and network-based features into account.

We analyzed over 4.5 million comments from Onet.pl politically-related sites enriched with the comment section.
A manual analysis was used to find discriminating features that could help to separate the users posting comments into groups. Next, we have designed an automatic separation method, which provided good results in troll detection  on test data sets. The conducted experiments show that our algorithm can detect users producing emotion evoking texts using only time patterns of user postings and network features. This can be useful for analysing political fora searching for highly emotional content without previous knowledge of language specific emotion evoking texts.
