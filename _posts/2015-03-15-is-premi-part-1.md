In this post, we describe the OPI future participation in the the International Conference on Pattern Recognition and Machine Intelligence, Warsaw, Poland, 2015, June 30 - July 3. The primary goal of the conference is to present state-of-the-art scientific results, encourage academic and industrial interaction, and promote collaborative research activities in Pattern Recognition, Machine Intelligence and related fields, involving scientists, engineers, professionals, researchers and students.

The conference is held every two years to make it an ideal platform for people to share their views and experiences in the said areas. This is the sixth conference of this series.

The industrial session of the PREMI2015 is devoted to Machine Intelligence and Big Data in the Industry. The goal of this session is to create a space for exchange of ideas between the leading researchers and industry practitioners. Presented work should be innovative and at the same time target specific practical problems or business requirements. Therefore, we decided to publish there our research results from diverse fields of Computational Intelligence. Below, we briefly describe three of submitted papers. Next three papers will be the content of the next post.

### Syntactic N-gram collection from a large-scale corpus of Polish websites ###

The research is devoted to the processing of multi-Terabyte web archive. The aim of this work is to create N-gram collection based on a large-scale corpus of all Polish sites on the Internet provided by The Common Crawl Foundation project.  The data after morphological and syntactic processing is used to extract flat and syntactic n-grams compilations. Syntactic N-grams are designed to express syntactic structure more devotedly than linear N-grams. They have many successful applications in machine learning within natural language processing and are extensively studied.

### A comparative study on Music Genre Classification Algorithms ###

Music Genre Classification is one of the fundamental tasks in the field of Music Information Retrieval (MIR). In this paper the performance of various music genre classification algorithms including Random Forests, Multi-Class Support Vector Machines and Deep Belief Networks is being compared. The study is based on the "Million Song Dataset" a~freely-available collection of audio features and metadata. The emphasis is put not only on classification accuracy but also on robustness and scalability of algorithms.

### Sentiment analysis of short Polish texts ###

There is introduced a fully automated process for sentiment analysis in short texts in Polish language. Process consists of (a) generation of emotion lexicon using Twitter annotated messages (b) building sentiment data set using annotated messages and the generated lexicon, (c) training NEAT genetic algorithm using previously prepared data set and (d) the final evaluation using 10 fold cross vali-dation. We show that this method provides good results and can be used to sim-plify sentiment analysis processes for Polish language content.
