Sentiment analysis tools are important in the context of Internet communities analysis. Currently there is a few online tools (e.g. Sentistrength [1]), but their support for Polish language is minimal at best.poema (**POlish sEntiMent Analyzer**) is a new, simple tool designed for batch sentiment analysis in Polish language, with additional social network evaluation. With an easy to use interface, wide customization settings and multiple import/export data formats, poema aims to be the first choice tool for sentiment analysis in Polish language.

###Software Description
poema allows users to evaluate sentiment of large quantities of texts using various sentiment analysis models, both simple dictionary based and machine learning based, enclosed in simple web based application. Users can modify sentiment dictionary and use custom one to fine-tune analysis process, customize models and check detailed information about analyzed text. One of poema key features is an ability to process sentiment in social networks, provided texts contain information required to build such network. poema consists of four basic modules, responsible for program functionality. Additional demonstration module and tools are available as well.

####Sentiment Dictionary Editor
Sentiment Dictionary editor provides simple way to display sentiment dictionary. poema provides predefined set of terms described with sentiment weights, gathered from automatic analysis of twitter messages, that can be filtered and each sentiment term can be changed. User can add and remove each entry to make dictionary suitable for their need. 

Full, custom, user-defined dictionaries can be uploaded and used in model training and sentiment analysis. Custom dictionaries must be defined in CSV files.

####Model Selection Module
This module allows user to train dedicated models or select existing, pre-trained ones. It provides selection of pre-trained ML (machine learning based) and simple dictionary based models that can be trained using built-in or custom training data sets. Trained models can be stored for future use, alongside dictionaries and data used to train them.

Available pre-trained ML models:

* FeedForward Neural Network model, based on [2]
* NEAT Neural Network model
* Naive Bayes model

Available pre-trained simple models:

* Simple addition model
* Simple $\log^2$ model, based on [3]

####Text Analysis Component
Text analysis component allows batch text preview and analysis. It is mostly designed to use with comments and twitter messages (that have defined user-author) but can be also used with any text. In addition to basic text sentiment estimation, module can also display detailed results (consisting of word-to-word interaction information, bigram detection and emotion of each individual word)

User texts can be uploaded as json files in specified format. Analysis outcome can be exported as CSV and json files for off-line analysis.

####Social Network Analysis Module
Social network analysis module allows evaluating of social network properties, such as in- and out-degree, user (text author) total received sentiment (sentiment of texts directed to users), total generated sentiment (sentiment of texts written by user) and sentiment of each interaction between user. It also provides visualization of users and interactions. Social network data can be exported to one of the popular network analysis software formats for off-line analysis.

####Demonstration View
Demonstration view enables to verify system functionality using pre-trained, Naive Bayes models on a single text input by the user, and provides tools for detailed analysis of results.

####Additional Tools
There are three additional tools included in poema:

* System management tool that allows managing underlying automated sentiment dictionary creation and model training system. 
* Custom model creation tool allows for easy model creation using sandboxed Lua scripts with simple API. 
* REST API allows text analysis module to be used from 3rd party tools. 

###Evaluation and Availability
poema will be freely available to general public from Fall 2015. Availability will be announced on http://lil-devel.opi.org.pl/ai-web.
