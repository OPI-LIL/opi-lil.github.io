###Data Science meetup
Yesterday we had the pleasure to deliver a presentation at Data Science meetup in Warsaw about word2vec and how we trained it on the polish internet (filtered from Common Crawl, se our previous posts) and how it affected our dictionary based sentiment analysis tools. [Our presentation is available here]({{site.url}}/assets/other/2015_11_20_Meetup_word2vec.pdf). Follow [opi-lil](https://twitter.com/opi_lil) us on twitter to stay updated :)
