Two weeks ago we went The Luxembourg BabelNet Workshop, where had the opputunity to meet Roberto Navigli and make a speech in the First Hemicycle Of the European Parliment. How did it go? Read on!

The Luxembourg BabelNet Workshop was a technical workshop on BabelNet and Babelfy. The workshop took place over two days. The first day was a technical guided tour. The second day consisted of four case studies of resources.
Those two extremely interesting resources can be defined as below (citing authors of the systems):

 - BabelNet (http://babelnet.org/) is both a multilingual encyclopedic dictionary, with lexicographic and encyclopedic coverage of terms, and a semantic network which connects concepts and named entities in a very large network of semantic relations, made up of about 14 million entries, called Babel synsets. Each Babel synset represents a given meaning and contains all the synonyms which express that meaning in a range of different languages.
 - Babelfy (http://babelfy.org/) is a unified, multilingual, graph-based approach to Entity Linking and Word Sense Disambiguation based on a loose identification of candidate meanings coupled with a densest subgraph heuristic which selects high-coherence semantic interpretations.

During the workshop there were planned Lightning Talk sessions. In the two of them we had a pleasure to present our research in three talks:

 - Whose line is it anyway - Automatic multilingual emotion annotation of movie dialogues (Wojciech Stokowiec) [Paper](http://babelnet.org/lux/files/2.%20Stokowiec%20W.%20-%20Whose%20line%20is%20it%20anyway%20-%20Automatic%20multilingual%20emotion%20annotation%20of%20movie%20dialogues.pdf) [Presentation](http://babelnet.org/lux/files/LUX-02.03.16%20-%20BabelNet%20Workshop%20-%20Wojciech%20Stokowiec.pdf)
 - Assessment of historical figures using BabelNet (Maciej Kowalski and Szymon Roziewski) [Paper](http://babelnet.org/lux/files/3.%20Roziewski%20-%20Assessment%20of%20historical%20figures%20using%20BabelNet.pdf) [Presentation](http://babelnet.org/lux/files/LUX-02.03.16%20-%20BabelNet%20Workshop%20-%20Szymon%20Roziewski.pdf)
 - Search Results Clustering enriched with BabelNet (Marek Kozłowski and Maciej Kazuła) [Paper](http://babelnet.org/lux/files/6.%20Koz%C5%82owski%20and%20Kazu%C5%82a%20-%20Search%20Results%20Clustering%20enriched%20with%20BabelNet.pdf) [Presentation](http://babelnet.org/lux/files/LUX-03.03.16%20-%20BabelNet%20Workshop%20-%20Marek%20Kozlowski.pdf)
